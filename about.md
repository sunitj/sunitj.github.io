I am a Bioinformatics professional, currently working as a Research Computing Specialist -- Bioinformatics at the [Michigan Geomicrobiology Lab](http://www.earth.lsa.umich.edu/geomicrobiology/Index.html), Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Michigan. 

I graduated with a Bachelor's (B.Tech, 2008) and later a Master's degree (MS, 2011) in Bioinformatics from Amity University (Noida, India) and University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, USA) respectively.

With over 4 years of experience analyzing Meta-omics and Comparative Genomic data using various bioinformatic tools, I have worked on various projects like:

* 'Studying potential drug targets for M.tb' 
* 'Studying novel nitrite oxidizers in the deep sea' 
* 'Analyzing meta-omic data for novel organisms with the goal of finding new drug candidates for infectious diseases and cancers' 
* 'Meta-omic study of the Mid-Cayman Rise hydrothermal vent systems, some of the deepest in the world' 
* [and many more](http://www.sunitjain.com/projects).

You can also find a complete list of my publications, [here](http://www.sunitjain.com/publications), with many more on their way.

I'm always looking for new opportunities. If you have questions that you think I may help you with, I encourage you to contact me through the form [here](http://www.sunitjain.com/contact).
